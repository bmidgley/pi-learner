    "We will refer in the code to the physical pin number, but it is always useful to be able to look at a diagram to tell what is available to use on each pin. Anything marked \"GPIO\" is a general-purpose input/output pin that we can assign to output a signal to drive the LED. When the signal is HIGH, it will allow current to light the LED.\n",

    "First, this is python code that uses libraries especially for pi. Python is a popular language for using the pi and it's also fairly easy to get started with.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first lines with \"import\" make it clear what other libraries and functions we will call on. We need GPIO functions for activating the LED as well as time functions for pausing between flashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we create a function to blink the LED. It will set the pin to HIGH to illuminate it with current and LOW when we want it off. It will return after flashing the LED once.\n",
    "\n",
    "In two steps, we tell the GPIO library we will use board pin numbering and we set \"led_pin\" to 11. With board pin numbering, this refers to the pin 11 on the physical connector. If you count your way up from the bottom, you can see in the diagram above this pin has the name \"GPIO17\". The 17 isn't really important to us, but we had to choose a pin that was a GPIO so we could use it for general purpose input/output (output specifically).\n",
    "\n",
    "Pin 11 has to be designated for output next.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we use a range to cycle through a loop to blink the light. It blinks once for 0 and up to 5.\n",
