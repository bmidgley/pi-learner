    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In two steps, we tell the GPIO library we will use board pin numbering and we set \"led_pin\" to 11. With board pin numbering, this refers to the pin 11 on the physical connector. If you count your way up from the bottom, you can see in the diagram above this pin has the name \"GPIO17\". The 17 isn't really important to us, but we had to choose a pin that was a GPIO so we could use it for general purpose input/output (output specifically).\n",
    "\n",
    "Pin 11 has to be designated for output next.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally we use a range to cycle through a loop to blink the light. It blinks once for 0 and up to 5.\n",

    "Don't worry if you make a mistake in coding. The output below the code will be a helpful message trying to get you back on track. We'll have lots of opportunity to improve or occasionally break the code. For example, can you find and fix the problem in the code below that prevents it from running? Python tries to tell us as concisely as it can, but it sometimes comes off a little terse. Fix the error and hit shift and enter to run it again.\n",
